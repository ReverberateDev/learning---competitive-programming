For all testcases
q <= 10^7, s will be a string of lowercase alphabet consisting of not more than 3 characters, i, j <= 10^5
int max_q = 10000000;
int max_slen = 10;
int max_i = 100000;
int max_j = 100000;

Subtask 1
q <= 10^7, once a trainer goes to a lab, the trainer will not go to any other labs
Solution:
Keep track of how many trainers have entered a lab

Subtask 2
q <= 10^4
Solution:
Using an ordered map to store trainer locations will work

Subtask 3
q <= 2*10^5
Solution:
Using only an unordered map will work for this
