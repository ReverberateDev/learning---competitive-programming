Legend:  
The trainers of December Course 2024 are arranging participants into $N$ groups, numbered $1$ to $N$, placed in a row. For simplicity, each participant in group $i$ initially wears a shirt of color $i$.  

The trainers can issue commands to modify group shirt colors or check specific color statistics. They provide $Q$ commands in total, which must be processed in the given order. Commands are of the following two types:  

1. $1\ x\ c$: Change the shirt color of trainee $x$ and all connected trainees (trainees reachable by moving through adjacent groups with the same shirt color) to color $c$.  

2. $2\ c$: Report how many trainees are currently wearing shirts of color $c$.  

Input format:  
The input is given in the following format:  

$N\ Q$  

$query1$  

$query2$  

$\vdots$  

$queryQ$  

Each query is in one of the following formats:  
$1\ x\ c$  
$2\ c$  

Output format:  
Let $q$ be the number of type $2$ queries. Print $q$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains the answer to the $i$-th type $2$ query.
